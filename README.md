# NOMCOM Public planning repo for 2020 in Eugene Oregon

Euegene is excited to host the Nation of Makers Conference 2020

:tada: We are glad you found our public planning repo! :tada:

We started this in response to a Joel Leonard post on social media "[Wishlist 2020 year at NOMCON in Eugene Oregon. What would you like to see happen?](https://www.facebook.com/joel.leonard.3/posts/10217344644225396)"

[Please feel free to add issues](https://github.com/EugTech/nomcom-2020-plan/issues) so everything gets captured and we can and have a conversation in the issue comments.

We are still forming the leadership team and plan to run this like an [Open Project](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/) starting in July.

Thanks for stopping by!
